# Rationale
xDaiPunks has the goal to become a NFT project that is fully owned and managed by a DAO. The process to become a DAO will be a gradual one. To kick-start this process, xDaiPunks will have to be a fully independent project with it's own unique Punks.

This proposal is to adjust and improve the look and feel of our beloved Punks, while keeping their heritage alive.

xDaiPunks is a project that lives on the xDai blockchain. As we have a strong bond with xDai, our Punks will need to reflect this.

The proposal for design changes already received positive response from the community. And the term "Bit-Shifting" was already coined (pun). What is "Bit-Shifting"? Currently our Punks are png files of 24x24 pixels. The idea is to Bit-Shift that to a higher resolutution. By doing so, we can create higher resolution Punks with more detail and more depth. It also allows our Punks to receive a nice tattoo of the xDai logo. We have the go-ahead of the community to create pixelated 3d xDaiPunks.

The xDaiPunks will become unique. Not only unique in the xDai ecosystem but also unique in the entire NFT ecosystem. The 3d Punks are generated from a master model that will contain all attributes, types and skin colors. This 3d model is an open-source model. With this model,  

# Requirements
- The xDaiPunks will need to be unique while keeping their heritage alive
- Implementing Bit-Shifting
- The xDaiPunks will stay pixelated
- The xDaiPunks will be 3d models. For marketplaces PNG's and SVG's will be generated from these models.
- 10.000 unique 3d xDaiPunks are being created. They will keep the same attributes and ranking as the 2d homage xDaiPunks.
- The 3d xDaiPunks will be the basis of our goverance token and will play an important role within our marketplace

# Role
The 3d xDaiPunks will become the basis of our community and will play an important role in our community with regard to our governance token and marketplace. To become the basis of our community means that the large majority of the governance token will be air-dropped on the Punks and will be claimable by the xDaiPunk owners. 

# Punks
xDaiPunks have a ranking, a type and 0 to 7 attributes. Next to that they have a 3d render associated with them.

The individual 3d renders can be found in the punks3d folder https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xDaiPunks/xIP-000002/main/punks3d

The ranks, types and attributes of all punks can be found in the punks.json file in the punkData folder. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xDaiPunks/xIP-000002/main/punks/punks.json


# NFT changes
The 3d xDaiPunks will be immediatly available for xDaiPunks owners. The NFT contract will stay the same, but the genuineness check will receive an update. The 3d xDaiPunks will use the same contract and xDaiPunk owners will automatically receive the updated 3d xDaiPunks.

# xDaiPunks ownership
NFTs are all about ownership. So what do you own as a Punk hodler? You, of course, own the IP to the xDaiPunks that you own. Transferring ownership also means transferring IP. 

This means that you have the IP for the generated png from the 3d model. Next to that you will have the IP of the individiual attributes, type and skin color within the 3d model. This can be used top export your xDaiPunk to different formats, change angles etc.

# 3d xDaiPunk model
The master model is created with Magica Voxel. Is a very powerful open-source program to create voxels. This program can be downloaded here: https://ephtracy.github.io/

## How to use

### ⚠️ OS 
Although the program can run on a Mac, we advise to use Windows to run the program. This due to some issues with the Mac version of Magica Voxel. The issues on Mac are installing and outline management

### Model: Opening
- Start Magica Voxel
- Open the the file browser by clicking the "open folder" icon on the top right side of your screen
- Select the xDaiPunks.vox 3d model. This model can be found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xDaiPunks/xIP-000002/main/3dModel/xDaiPunks.vox

### Model: Editting
When you have opened the Magica Voxel xDaiPunks model, a simple base layer of a Punk will be shown. To show the correct type and attributes of your Punk, you need to open the outline panel. On the right side, there will be a panel which says "Project". To open the outline panel, click on the outline icon. 

You will now be shown all the types and attributes of the xDaiPunk model. In this panel you can show and hide types and attributes. The types are listed at the bottom of the outline panel.

From here on you can change angles and create renders.
