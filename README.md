# Rationale

xDaiPunks has the goal to become a NFT project that is fully owned and managed by a DAO. The process to become a DAO will be a gradual one. To kick-start this process, xDaiPunks will have to be a fully independent project with it's own unique Punks.

This proposal is to adjust and improve the look and feel of our beloved Punks, while keeping their heritage alive.

xDaiPunks is a project that lives on the xDai blockchain. As we have a strong bond with xDai, our Punks will need to reflect this.

The proposal for design changes already received positive response from the community. And the term "Bit-Shifting" was already coined (pun). What is "Bit-Shifting"? Currently our Punks are png files of 24x24 pixels. The idea is to Bit-Shift that to a higher resolutution. By doing so, we can create higher resolution Punks with more detail and more depth. It also allows our Punks to receive a nice tattoo of the xDai logo.

We have the go-ahead of the community to create pixelated 3d xDaiPunks.

The xDaiPunks will become unique. Not only unique in the xDai ecosystem but also unique in the entire NFT ecosystem.

# Requirements

- The xDaiPunks will need to be unique while keeping their heritage alive
- Implementing Bit-Shifting
- The xDaiPunks will stay pixelated
- The xDaiPunks will be 3d models. For marketplaces PNG's and SVG's will be generated from these models.
- 10.000 unique 3d xDaiPunks are being created. They will keep the same attributes and ranking as the 2d homage xDaiPunks.
- The 3d xDaiPunks will be the base of our goverance token and will play an important role within our marketplace and our governance token

# Role

The 3d xDaiPunks will become the basis of our community and will play an important role in our community with regard to our governance token and marketplace. To become the basis of our community means that the large majority of the governance token will be air-dropped on the current xDaiPunk owners. This means that xDaiPunk owners will receive the majority of the voting rights.

The air-drop needs to be fair. This means that the air-drop will happen on a pro rata basis. 1 xDaiPunk will get a certain amount of governance tokens air-dropped.

# NFT changes

The 3d xDaiPunks will be immediatly available for xDaiPunks owners. The NFT contract will stay the same, but the genuineness check will receive an update. The 3d xDaiPunks will use the same contract and xDaiPunk owners will automatically receive the updated 3d xDaiPunks.

# Second draft of a 3d xDaiPunk.

This is the second draft of a 3d xDaiPunk. It is the output of the current 3d model. ![3d xDaiPunk](https://github.com/xDaiPunks/xIP-000002/blob/main/drafts/3d-xDaiPunk.jpg)
